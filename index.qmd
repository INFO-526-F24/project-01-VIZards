## Abstract

This project will analyze the Tucson Police Departmentâ€™s Reported Crime dataset to gain insights into crime patterns, distributions, and trends in Tucson. By focusing on both temporal and spatial characteristics of criminal incidents, we aim to answer crucial questions around the frequency, type, and geographic distribution of crimes. The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven recommendations that could enhance public safety and assist in resource allocation. This analysis will offer the Tucson community meaningful insights, empowering both local authorities and residents with a better understanding of crime trends and potential preventative measures. Ethical considerations, including privacy and the potential for data misuse, will be prioritized to ensure that the findings are responsibly and constructively framed.
