    -   Major crime types were retained, and lesser-reported crimes were consolidated into the *Other* category.

2.  **Percentage Calculation**:

    -   Crime counts for each type were converted into percentages relative to the total crimes reported annually. This standardized comparison across years.

3.  **Trend Generation**:

    -   A new `Trend` column was created by aggregating the percentage values across years into a list. This column captures the historical pattern of each crime type.

4.  **Filtering Null Values**:

    -   Null or missing values were removed to ensure accuracy in trend analysis.

#### **Insights from Trends Analysis**:

1.  **Dominant Crime Types**:

    -   Over the years, *Larceny* and *Burglary* emerged as the most frequently reported crime categories, consistently making up the highest percentage of total crimes.

2.  **Temporal Variations**:

    -   Certain crime types (e.g., *Aggravated Assault*) showed steady trends, while others (e.g., *Robbery*) exhibited minor fluctuations in their annual percentages.

3.  **Decline or Increase Trends**:

    -   For specific categories such as *Burglary*, there appeared to be a gradual decline in the percentage contribution to overall crimes, possibly reflecting improved security measures or shifts in criminal activity.

4.  **Visualization**:

    -   Line graphs or bar charts of the `Trend` data visually depicted changes in the prevalence of each crime type, helping to identify increasing or decreasing trends.

**Purpose**: Trend analysis provided insights into the dynamic nature of crime over time, helping to forecast potential future patterns and allocate law enforcement resources accordingly.

## Methodology

Our approach to analyzing and visualizing the Tucson Police Department's Reported Crime dataset emphasizes interactive and intuitive visual storytelling techniques.
