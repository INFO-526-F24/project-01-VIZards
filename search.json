The dataset contains over 181,000 incidents, including details such as crime type, location, and date. The primary objective is to gain insights into crime trends over time, geographic distribution of offenses, and other significant patterns. By using data visualization techniques, we aim to present the findings in an engaging and informative way for decision-makers, law enforcement agencies, and the public.\nExpected Deliverables:\n\nDashboard representing crime patterns.\nA set of visualizations highlighting crime patterns over time (e.g., monthly/annual trends).\n\n\n\nGeographic heat maps showing the distribution of crimes across different wards and divisions in Tucson.\nA detailed report summarizing key findings and visualizations.\nA final presentation to showcase the visualizations and insights derived from the data.\n\n\nTeam Goals\n\nProject Goals:\n\nAnalyze crime trends: Identify patterns in reported crimes across different time periods (year, month, day) and locations (ward, division) in Tucson.\n\n\n\nVisualize crime distribution: Create compelling visualizations such as heat maps, bar charts, and line graphs to showcase crime data trends over time and space.\nUnderstand crime categories: Explore the types of crimes (e.g., burglary, homicide, assault) and their frequency to help uncover any significant trends or correlations.\nSupport decision-making: Provide insights through visualizations that could assist law enforcement, policy makers, and the community in understanding and responding to crime patterns effectively.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nData wrangling: Develop skills in cleaning, transforming, and preparing real-world datasets for analysis.\n\n\n\nData visualization: Learn to design and implement effective visualizations using tools like ggplot2.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Strengthen the ability to extract meaningful insights from large datasets by identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies.\nCollaboration and teamwork: Enhance communication and project management skills by working collaboratively within a team structure to deliver a data-driven project.\n\n\nTeam Roles and Responsibilities\n\nRoles (change as needed):\n\n\n\nProject Manager: [Ashwini R Jannu] – Ensures timelines are met, organizes meetings, and manages communications.\nData Analyst: [Lekhashree Honnavalli Jayarama, Mridula Kalaisevan] – Responsible for data cleaning, analysis, and exploratory\nVisualization Specialist: [Dhawal Gajwe, Hitharth Bharad] – Designs the final visualizations and makes aesthetic choices.\nDocumentation Lead: [Hardik Chemburkar, Ashwini R Jannu] – Keeps detailed notes, ensures all project decisions are documented, and handles the final report.\n\n\n\nResponsibilities:\nGeneral Responsibilities: Each team member is responsible for:\n\n\n\nParticipating actively in all meetings.\nCompleting their assigned tasks on time.\n\n\n\nCommunicating openly and promptly if issues arise.\n\nCommunication Plan\n\nMeeting Schedule: Weekly on Monday and Wed at 3.15 - 4.15 PM in person.\nPrimary Communication Platform: Whatsapp.\nDecision-Making Process: Decisions will be made by consensus; if a consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken.\n\nWork Plan and Timeline\n\nMilestones:\n\nMilestone 1 - Completed\nMilestone 2 - In process\n\nData Collection and Cleaning: Completed by [Date].\nExploratory Data Analysis: Completed by [Date].\nDesign of Visualizations: Completed by [Date].\nFinal Presentation and Report: Completed by [Date].\nTask Assignments: [Use a table to assign tasks to team members with due dates.]\n\nAccountability and Expectations\n\nAttendance Policy: All team members are expected to attend scheduled meetings unless previously discussed.\nQuality of Work: All deliverables should be completed to a professional standard.\nDeadlines: All members are responsible for meeting deadlines.
