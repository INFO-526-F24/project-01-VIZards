**Project Overview**

-   **Project Description:** This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing crime data reported to the Tucson Police Department from 2018 to the present. The dataset contains over 181,000 incidents, including details such as crime type, location, and date. The primary objective is to gain insights into crime trends over time, geographic distribution of offenses, and other significant patterns. By using data visualization techniques, we aim to present the findings in an engaging and informative way for decision-makers, law enforcement agencies, and the public.

-   **Expected Deliverables:**

    -   Dashboard representing crime patterns.

    -   A set of visualizations highlighting crime patterns over time (e.g., monthly/annual trends).

    <!-- -->

    -   Geographic heat maps showing the distribution of crimes across different wards and divisions in Tucson.

    -   A detailed report summarizing key findings and visualizations.

    -   A final presentation to showcase the visualizations and insights derived from the data.

**Team Goals**

-   **Project Goals:**

    -   **Analyze crime trends**: Identify patterns in reported crimes across different time periods (year, month, day) and locations (ward, division) in Tucson.

    -   **Visualize crime distribution**: Create compelling visualizations such as heat maps, bar charts, and line graphs to showcase crime data trends over time and space.

    -   **Understand crime categories**: Explore the types of crimes (e.g., burglary, homicide, assault) and their frequency to help uncover any significant trends or correlations.

    -   **Support decision-making**: Provide insights through visualizations that could assist law enforcement, policy makers, and the community in understanding and responding to crime patterns effectively.

-   **Learning Objectives:**

    -   **Data wrangling**: Develop skills in cleaning, transforming, and preparing real-world datasets for analysis.

    <!-- -->
